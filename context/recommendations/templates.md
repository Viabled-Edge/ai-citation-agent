# Recommendation Templates

## Purpose
Structured templates for generating specific, actionable recommendations with outreach targets based on audit findings. Replaces generic recommendations like "establish Wikipedia presence" with concrete actions.

## Philosophy (from Rokas feedback)
- Recommendations should be **achievable** and **realistic**
- Include **outreach targets** with contact information when possible
- Reference **specific competitor content** that drove their visibility
- Avoid expensive/impractical suggestions (Wikipedia costs $100s-$1000s)
- Focus on **data-driven** actions based on what sources LLMs actually cite

---

```

## Recommendations to AVOID

Per Rokas feedback, these are impractical for most brands:

| Recommendation | Why to Avoid | Alternative |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| "Create Wikipedia article" | $100s-$1000s, requires agencies, may be rejected | Focus on Crunchbase, industry directories |
| "Get featured on TechCrunch" | Requires newsworthy hook, very competitive | Target tier-2 industry publications |
| "Build knowledge graph presence" | Abstract, hard to action | Focus on structured data, directory listings |
| "Improve brand authority" | Vague, not actionable | Specific actions: reviews, mentions, content |

---

## Priority Scoring Matrix

When generating recommendations, score based on:

| Factor | Low (1) | Medium (2) | High (3) |
|--------|---------|------------|----------|
| Impact | Marginal improvement | Noticeable improvement | Significant ranking change |
| Effort | 10+ hours | 4-10 hours | 1-4 hours |
| Speed | 8+ weeks | 2-8 weeks | 1-2 weeks |
| Confidence | Speculative | Based on patterns | Direct evidence from audit |

**Priority Score = (Impact × Confidence) / Effort**

---
