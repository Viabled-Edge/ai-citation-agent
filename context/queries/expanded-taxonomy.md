2. **Select 7-8 queries** per platform:
   - 2 evaluative (baseline visibility)
   - 2 comparative (competitive positioning)
   - 2 use-case (practical applications)
   - 1-2 brand-specific (direct recognition)
3. **Customize templates** with actual brand name and category
4. **Ensure cross-platform consistency** (same queries across Perplexity, ChatGPT, Gemini)

### Template Customization:
- Replace `[Brand]` with actual brand name
- Replace `[category]` with product category
- Replace `[Competitor]` with known competitors
- Replace `[use case]` with relevant application
- Replace `[industry]` with target vertical
